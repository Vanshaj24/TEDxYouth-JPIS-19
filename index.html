<div class="about">
  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxYouth@JPIS, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
  TEDxYouth@JPIS has had a marvelous journey, being founded in 2015  by students to spark powerful ideas within the vibrant Jayshree Periwal International School and the Jaipur community to challenge ideas and create positive impacts for the world. Having 4 events till date with each outperforming the last, every year we see a unique theme inspire the event, including ‘Discovery’, ‘Waves’, ‘Unlock, Unbox, Unleash’ and ‘Shatter’. With past speakers such as the acclaimed director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, cricket-phenomenon Suresh Raina, football legend Bhaichung Bhutia, transgender activist Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, India Today’s group editorial director Raj Chengappa, renowned comedian Cyrus Broacha, CEO and MD of InfoEdge India Hitesh Oberoi and celebrated IPS officer Amit Lodha - we felt it best to keep the flame alight and host an event this year. For the 2020 edition, we bring to you ‘Wildfires’: an ode to the way in which ground-breaking visions and ideas have the potential to spread like “wildfires”.
